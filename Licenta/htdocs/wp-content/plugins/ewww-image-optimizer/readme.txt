Reduce file sizes for images within WordPress including NextGEN Gallery and GRAND FlAGallery. Uses jpegtran, optipng/pngout, and gifsicle.

== Description ==

The EWWW Image Optimizer is a WordPress plugin that will automatically and losslessly optimize your images as you upload them to your blog. It can also optimize the images that you have already uploaded in the past. It is also now possible to convert your images automatically to the file format that will produce the smallest image (make sure you read the WARNINGS).

By default, EWWW Image Optimizer uses lossless optimization techniques, so your image quality will be exactly the same before and after the optimization. The only thing that will change is your file size. The one small exception to this is GIF animations. While the optimization is technically lossless, you will not be able to properly edit the animation again without performing an --unoptimize operation with gifsicle. The gif2png and jpg2png conversions are also lossless but the png2jpg process is not lossless.

Images are optimized using the [jpegtran](http://jpegclub.org/jpegtran/), [optipng](http://optipng.sourceforge.net/), [pngout](advsys.net/ken/utils.htm), and [gifsicle](http://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/) image tools (available for free). For PNG files, either optipng or pngout can be used. If you want the best optimization, install both, set optipng to level 3 (beyond that is just crazy and rarely yields significant gains) and pngout to level 0. Images are converted using the above tools and GD or 'convert' (ImageMagick).

EWWW Image Optimizer calls optimization utilities directly which is well suited to shared hosting situations where these utilities may already be installed. Pre-compiled binaries/executables are provided for optipng, gifsicle, and jpegtran. Pngout can be installed with one-click from the settings page.

**Why use EWWW Image Optimizer?**

1. **Your pages will load faster.** Smaller image sizes means faster page loads. This will make your visitors happy, and can increase ad revenue.
1. **Faster backups.** Smaller image sizes also means faster backups.
1. **Less bandwidth usage.** Optimizing your images can save you hundreds of KB per image, which means significantly less bandwidth usage.
1. **Super fast.** Because it runs on your own server, you donâ€™t have to wait for a third party service to receive, process, and return your images. You can optimize hundreds of images in just a few minutes. PNG files take the longest, but you can adjust the settings for your situation.
1. **Better PNG optimization.** YOu can use pngout and optipng in conjunction.
1. **Root access not needed** Pre-compiled binaries are made available to install directly within the Wordpress folder. 

= NextGEN Integration =

Features re-optimization capability, and bulk optimizing. The NextGEN Bulk Optimize function is located near the bottom of the NextGEN menu, and will optimize all images in all galleries.
NOTE: Does not optimize thumbnails on initial upload, 1.4.1+ will provide the option to optimize thumbnails after uploading images.

= GRAND Flash Album Gallery Integration =

Features optimization on upload capability, re-optimization, and bulk optimizing. The Bulk Optimize function is located near the bottom of the FlAGallery menu, and will optimize all images in all galleries. It is also possible to optimize groups of images in a gallery, or multiple galleries at once.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the 'ewww-image-optimizer' plugin to your '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Ensure jpegtran, optipng, pngout and gifsicle are installed on your Linux server (basic installation instructions are below if they are not). You will receive a warning when you activate the plugin if they are not present. This message will go away once you have them installed.
1. The plugin will attempt to install jpegtran, optipng, and gifsicle automatically for you. This requires that the wp-content folder is writable by the user running the web server.
1. If the automatic install did not work, find the appropriate binaries for your system in the ewww-image-optimizer plugin folder, copy them to wp-content/ewww/ and remove the OS 'tag' (like -linux or -fbsd). No renaming is necessary on Windows, just copy the .exe files to the wp-content/ewww folder. IMPORTANT: Do not symlink or modify the binaries in any way, or they will not pass the security checks.
1. *Optional* Visit the settings page to enable/disable specific tools and turn on advanced optimization features.
1. Done!

= Installing pngout =

Pngout is new in version 1.1.0 and is not enabled by default because it is resource intensive. Optipng is the preferred PNG optimizer if you have resource (CPU) constraints. Pngout is also not open-source for those who care about such things, but the command-line version is free.

1. Go to the settings page.
1. Uncheck the option to disable pngout and Save your settings.
1. Click the link in the Plugin Status area to install pngout for your server, and the plugin will download the pngout archive, unpack it, and install the appropriate version for your server.
1. Adjust the pngout level according to your needs. Level 0 gives the best results, but can take up to a minute or more on a single image.

= Installing optipng =

1. Optipng is now bundled with the plugin. If it isn't working for some reason, keep going...
1. If you have root access to your server, you can install optipng from the standard repositories (yum/rpm or apt/deb). If you are on shared hosting, read on... These steps can/should generally all be done via the command line
1. Download the latest stable version of [optipng](http://optipng.sourceforge.net/) to your home directory
1. Ensure libpng and zlib are installed. If they are not, you're on your own there (but maybe you need a new web host...)
1. Uncompress optipng: *tar xvzf optipng-0.7.4.tar.gz && cd optipng-0.7.4*
1. Configure and compile optipng: *./configure && make*
1. If you have root access, install it with *make install*
1. If not, copy the binary from */optipng-0.7.4/src/optipng/optipng* to the ewww tool folder (wordpress/wp-content/ewww/optipng-custom).

= Installing jpegtran =

1. Jpegtran is now bundled with the plugin. If it isn't working for some reason, keep going...
1. If you have root access to your server, jpegtran is part of the libjpeg-turbo-progs on Debian/Ubuntu, and likely something similar on rpm distros (Fedora, CentOS, RHEL, SuSE). If you are on shared hosting, read on... These steps can/should generally all be done via the command line
1. Download the latest stable version of [jpegtran](http://www.ijg.org/) to your home directory
1. Uncompress jpegtran: *tar xvzf jpegsrc.v9.tar.gz && cd jpeg-9*
1. Configure and compile jpegtran: *./configure --disable-shared && make*
1. If you have root access, install it with *make install*
1. If not, copy the binary from */jpeg-9/jpegtran* to the ewww tool folder (wordpress/wp-content/ewww/jpegtran-custom).

= Installing gifsicle =

1. Gifsicle is now bundled with the plugin. If it isn't working for you, keep going...
1. If you have root access to your server, you can install gifsicle from the standard repositories (yum/rpm or apt/deb). If you are on shared hosting, read on... These steps can/should generally all be done via the command line
1. Download the latest version of [gifsicle](http://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/) to your home directory
1. Uncompress gifsicle: *tar xvzf gifsicle-1.70.tar.gz && cd gifsicle-1.70*
1. Configure and compile gifsicle (we disable gifview and gifdiff as they are not needed): *./configure --disable-gifdiff --disable-gifview && make*
1. If you have root access, install it with *make install*
1. If not, copy the binary from */gifsicle-1.70/src/gifsicle* to the ewww tool folder (wordpress/wp-content/ewww/gifsicle-custom).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the plugin replace existing images? =

Yes, but only if the optimized version is smaller. The plugin should NEVER create a larger image.

= The bulk optimizer doesn't seem to be working, what can I do? =

First, upgrade to the latest version. Since version 1.0.8, each image is given 50 seconds to complete (which actually doesn't include time used by the optimization utilities). You can also increase the setting max_execution_time in your php.ini file. That said, there are other timeouts with Apache, and possibly other limitations of your webhost. If you've tried everything else, the last thing to look for is large PNG files. In my tests on a shared hosting setup, "large" is anything over 300 KB. You can first try decreasing the PNG optimization level in the settings. If that doesn't work, perhaps you ought to convert that PNG to JPG. Screenshots are often done as PNG files, but that is a poor choice for anything with photographic elements.

= What are the supported operating systems? =

I've tested it on Windows (with Apache), Linux, Mac OSX, and FreeBSD.

= How are JPGs optimized? =

Using the command *jpegtran -copy all -optimize -progressive -outfile optimized-file original-file*. Optionally, the -copy switch gets the 'none' parameter if you choose to strip metadata from your JPGs on the options page.

= How are PNGs optimized? =

There are two parts (and both are optional - you can run either or both). First, using the command *pngout-static -s2 original-file*. Second, by using the command *optipng -o2 original-file*. You can adjust the optimization levels for both tools on the settings page. Optipng is a derivative of pngcrush, which is another widely used png optimization utility.

= How are GIFs optimized? =

Using the command *gifsicle -b -O3 --careful original file*. This is particularly useful for animated GIFs, and can also streamline your color palette. That said, if your GIF is not animated, you should strongly consider converting it to a PNG. PNG files are almost always smaller, they just don't do animations. The following command would do this for you on a Linux system with imagemagick: *convert somefile.gif somefile.png*

= Why not just convert GIFs to PNGs then? =

Go for it, version 1.2+ makes this possible so long as you have either one of the PNG optimizers available.

= I want to know more about image optimization, and why you chose these options/tools. =

That's not a question, but since I made it up, I'll answer it. See the Image Optimization sections for [Yslow - Yahoo](http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#opt_images) and [Google PageSpeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/best-practices/payload#CompressImages). Pngout was suggested by a user and in tests optimizes better than Optipng, and best (usually) when they are used together.

== Screenshots ==

1. Plugin settings page.
2. Additional optimize column added to media listing. You can see your savings, manually optimize individual images, and restore originals (converted only).
3. Bulk optimization page. You can optimize all your images at once and resume a previous bulk optimization. This is very useful for existing blogs that have lots of images.
